## An Open-Source python password manager
The trick in using this is to put it on USB Stick and plug it in when u need your password
passwords are locally stored in json files but are encrypted based on the master password you enter
### To use you need Python 3 and cryptography dependency

`pip install cryptography`

On Linux its installed by default atleast on Debian (Distro I Use)
